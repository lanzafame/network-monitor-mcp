# Network Monitor MCP Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Build a production-ready MCP server in Go for network packet monitoring and security analysis, enabling Claude to inspect network traffic for anomalies.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure [COMPLETE]
- [x] Set up Go project structure
- [x] Create go.mod with required dependencies
- [x] Implement MCP server foundation
- [x] Set up JSON-RPC 2.0 communication

### Phase 2: Packet Capture [COMPLETE]
- [x] Implement packet sniffer using gopacket
- [x] Support WiFi interface selection
- [x] Add BPF filter support
- [x] Create ring buffer for packet storage
- [x] Parse TCP, UDP, DNS protocols

### Phase 3: MCP Tools [COMPLETE]
- [x] Implement capture_start tool
- [x] Implement capture_stop tool
- [x] Implement get_packets with filtering
- [x] Implement analyze_traffic tool
- [x] Implement get_suspicious tool

### Phase 4: Security Analysis [COMPLETE]
- [x] Port scan detection algorithm
- [x] Malicious DNS detection
- [x] Data exfiltration detection
- [x] Anomaly pattern matching
- [x] Threat severity classification

### Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment [COMPLETE]
- [x] Create comprehensive README
- [x] Add usage examples
- [x] Include security considerations
- [x] Provide troubleshooting guide
- [x] Document architecture

## Technical Requirements Met
- Real packet capture (no mocks)
- Production-ready error handling
- Proper resource management
- Thread-safe implementation
- Complete MCP protocol support

## Security Features Implemented
- SYN scan detection
- DNS blacklist checking
- DGA domain detection
- Large data transfer monitoring
- Suspicious port detection
- External connection tracking

## Ready for Deployment
The network monitor MCP server is now fully implemented and ready for use in enterprise security monitoring scenarios.
